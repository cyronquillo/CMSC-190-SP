# CMSC-190-SP

The overall purpose of the study is to provide a numerical <br />
score to a given transcript of a speech, interview, debate, <br />
and/or hearing based on how factual its content is. The specific <br />
objectives of the study are the following: <br />
<br />
• to collect news from reliable and satiric websites using <br />
a web scraper; <br />
• to collect transcripts of speeches, interviews, debates, <br />
and/hearings for training and test data; <br />
• to classify each of the transcript’s sentences as CFS, UFS, <br />
or NFS using SVM, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network; <br />
• to provide appropriate weights for each sentence in the <br />
given input transcript based on its classification; <br />
• to evaluate the performance of the models used for sentence <br />
classification by computing the accuracy, precision, <br />
recall, and f1 score; and <br />
• to verify the certainty of a sentence’s content using <br />
the collected news through Semantic Similarity Analysis <br />
using Triple Extraction Approach. <br />
