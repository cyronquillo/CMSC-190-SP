# CMSC-190-SP

The overall purpose of the study is to provide a numerical
score to a given transcript of a speech, interview, debate,
and/or hearing based on how factual its content is. The specific
objectives of the study are the following:
• to collect news from reliable and satiric websites using a
web scraper;
• to collect transcripts of speeches, interviews, debates,
and/hearings for training and test data;
• to classify each of the transcript’s sentences as CFS, UFS,
or NFS using SVM, Logistic Regression, and Neural
Network;
• to provide appropriate weights for each sentence in the
given input transcript based on its classification;
• to evaluate the performance of the models used for sentence
classification by computing the accuracy, precision,
recall, and f1 score; and
• to verify the certainty of a sentence’s content using
the collected news through Semantic Similarity Analysis
using Triple Extraction Approach.
